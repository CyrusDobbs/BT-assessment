Run application through nodeReporter.java.

Assumptions:
 - Nodes must say HELLO before losing/finding another node.
 - A nodes status is determined by the latest notification.


ISSUES:
 - Unfortunatly, I have had exams during the time I have been set to finish this task and 
   a pre-booked holiday starting on the Saturday after. Because of this I have not been able to spend
   as much time as I would have liked. I was unsure how the UNKNOWN system works and, given more time, I would 
   have tried to get in contact with someone at BT for clarification. I therefor have not included 'UNKNOWN'
   in my application.
