Run application through nodeReporter.java.

Assumptions:
 - Nodes must exist through a HELLO statement or from being found/lost
   before it can lose/find another node.
 - A nodes status is determined by the latest notification in terms of the time stamp
   of when the notification was sent from the node (as opposed from received by the
   monitoring system.


ISSUES:
 - Unfortunately, I have had exams during the time I have been set to finish this task and
   a pre-booked holiday starting on the Saturday after. Because of this I have not been able to spend
   as much time as I would have liked. I was unsure how the UNKNOWN system works and, given more time, I would 
   have tried to get in contact with someone at BT for clarification. I therefor have not included 'UNKNOWN'
   in my application.
